# calculator-intermediate
A console calculator I'm working on to improve my math operation skills in C++.
At current state, it includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, x to the power of y, square root, logarithm in base-10, sine and cosine functions.
In time I'll edit it and add more to it.
