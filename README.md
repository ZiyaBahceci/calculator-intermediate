# calculator-intermediate
A console calculator I'm working on to improve my math operation skills in C++.
As launch, it includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root and logarithm in base-10.
In time I'll edit it and add more to it, such as trigonometry and more advanced logarithm. Perhaps more!
